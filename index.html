    <h2>🧪 About the Experiment</h2>
    <p>In August 2025, I ran an experiment in South Florida to test whether cutting the tip of milkweed seeds (a process called scarification) would help them germinate faster than seeds left untouched. I tested this method on both swamp milkweed (<i>Asclepias incarnata</i>) and butterfly weed (<i>Asclepias tuberosa</i>).</p>

  <section class="glass section">
    <h2>🛠️ Materials & Setup</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Swamp milkweed and butterfly weed seeds (not cold-stratified)</li>
      <li>Clean cups filled with water</li>
      <li>Scissors (to scarify seeds)</li>
      <li>Float container (optional)</li>
      <li>Shaded outdoor area (South Florida climate)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I cut the tip off half of the seeds and placed both groups (scarified and non-scarified) in cups of water, then floated them outdoors in the shade. The temperature stayed warm and humid throughout.</p>

    <h2>📈 Results – Swamp Milkweed (12 Hours)</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Treatment</th>
          <th>Germination Status</th>
          <th>Time</th>

      <tbody>
        <tr>

          <td>No change</td>
          <td>12 hours</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Scarified seeds sprouted significantly faster than non-scarified ones.</p>

      <thead>
        <tr>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Scarified</td>

          <td>24 hours</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Non-scarified</td>
          <td>No change</td>
          <td>24 hours</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Even though butterfly weed seeds floated and are larger, scarification still made them germinate earlier.</p>

    <h2>🔬 Why This Works</h2>
    <p>Scarification helps water and oxygen get past the seed coat and reach the embryo faster. In a hot and humid climate like South Florida, this triggers quick germination even without cold stratification. Most guides recommend cold stratifying milkweed seeds for 30 days, but this experiment shows it's not always necessary!</p>

    <h2>🌞 Warm Climate Milkweed Germination Guide</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Use fresh seeds (even without pre-treatment)</li>
      <li>Cut the tip of each seed carefully with clean scissors</li>
      <li>Place seeds in clean cups of water, 1" deep</li>
      <li>Float or keep in a warm shaded area (not direct sun)</li>
      <li>Look for white root tips in 12–24 hours!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This method is perfect for Florida, Texas, and other warm zones where milkweed grows naturally but may not need cold winters to trigger sprouting.</p>
