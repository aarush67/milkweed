      <h2>🌱 Experiment Overview</h2>
      <p>This experiment tests whether scarifying milkweed seeds (cutting off the tip) leads to faster or better germination compared to untreated seeds.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="glass-card">
      <h2>🔬 Method</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seed Types:</strong> Swamp Milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) and Butterfly Weed (Asclepias tuberosa)</li>
        <li><strong>Scarification:</strong> Tip of each seed was carefully snipped off using scissors.</li>
        <li><strong>Conditions:</strong> Seeds were placed in cups of water, floated in foam cups outside in shaded South Florida conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Equal volume of clean water for each cup.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cold Stratification:</strong> Seeds were fresh and untreated (no fridge time).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="glass-card">
      <h2>📈 Observations (Day 1)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After just <strong>12 hours</strong>, 7 out of 8 scarified swamp milkweed seeds showed a white root emerging.</li>
        <li>Non-scarified seeds showed no visible change.</li>
        <li>Butterfly weed seeds (larger and floating) showed <strongtiny white dots</strong> on scarified seeds within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>No sprouting seen in non-scarified butterfly weed seeds.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>💡 Conclusions (So Far)</h2>
      <p>
        The experiment strongly suggests that scarification significantly speeds up germination for both swamp milkweed and butterfly weed — even without cold stratification. 
        While the non-treated seeds remained dormant, scarified seeds began germinating almost immediately.
      </p>
      <p>Out of 8 scarified swamp milkweed seeds, 7 successfully germinated in just 12 hours. That’s an impressive ~88% germination rate in less than one day.</p>

      <h2>📍 Location & Setup</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Outdoor shade in South Florida (hot & humid climate)</li>
        <li><strong>Containers:</strong> Plastic cups floating inside foam cups with water</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Indirect natural light (no direct sun)</li>
        <li><strong>Scarification Tools:</strong> Clean scissors used to snip the tip</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🧠 Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Milkweed is essential for monarch butterflies, but many growers struggle with poor seed germination. This experiment shows that simply cutting the tip of the seed can dramatically improve results — even without refrigeration or expensive supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
        These findings can help native plant enthusiasts, pollinator gardeners, and educators save time and resources when growing milkweed.
