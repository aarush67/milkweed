    <h1>Scarification Experiment on Milkweed & Butterfly Weed</h1>
    <p><strong>Date of Experiment:</strong> August 12–13, 2025<br>
    <strong>Location:</strong> South Florida (shaded outdoor area)</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This experiment was conducted to investigate whether scarifying milkweed and butterfly weed seeds helps them germinate faster compared to non-scarified seeds. Scarification is the process of weakening the seed coat, and in this case, it was done by cutting the tip of each seed slightly.
    </p>

    <h2>Materials Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Swamp milkweed seeds (Asclepias incarnata)</li>
      <li>Butterfly weed seeds (Asclepias tuberosa)</li>
      <li>Plastic cups filled with clean tap water</li>
      <li>Labels to mark scarified and non-scarified seeds</li>
      <li>Outdoor location (shaded, warm South Florida climate)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      Two sets of seeds were prepared for both swamp milkweed and butterfly weed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scarified:</strong> Tip of each seed carefully clipped with scissors or a blade.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-scarified:</strong> Seeds were left untreated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All seeds were placed in separate labeled cups filled with water. These cups were placed in a larger floatation cup to stabilize temperature and conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>
      Within just 12 hours, all but one scarified milkweed seed had begun to sprout. White root tips (radicles) were clearly visible, indicating germination had started. In contrast, the non-scarified seeds showed no visible signs of germination.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar result was seen with butterfly weed seeds. The scarified ones showed tiny white dots after 24 hours, a sign of early germination. The untreated seeds remained unchanged.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      The data strongly suggest that scarification dramatically improves germination speed in both swamp milkweed and butterfly weed seeds. In a warm, humid, Florida climate with no cold stratification, scarified seeds began germinating in under 24 hours. This is significant, as milkweed seeds typically require cold stratification to germinate.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Scarifying milkweed and butterfly weed seeds can significantly increase germination speed and rate — even in non-ideal conditions and without cold stratification. For gardeners in tropical or subtropical regions like South Florida, scarification offers a reliable method to boost propagation success.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Include more seed varieties (e.g. common milkweed, tropical milkweed)</li>
      <li>Measure long-term survival rates of seedlings</li>
      <li>Test with soil vs. water germination</li>
    </ul>
